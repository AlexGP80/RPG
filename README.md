RPG Games Utilities

A mess consisting of diverse tools I make for the TTRPG games I run.

- Rolemaster/API: Tools for the spanish version of Rolemaster published in the 90s by Joc International. They're suitable for the Roll20 API, hence the usage of JavaScript. They allow to get the attack, critical and maneuver roll results fast without needing to consult the rulebook tables, enabling games to run way smoother. TBD: make changes so this tools can be used in the command line using node.js
