RPG Games Utilities

A mess consisting of diverse tools I make for the TTRPG games I run.

## Rolemaster/API
Tools for the spanish version of Rolemaster published in the 90s by Joc International. They're suitable for the Roll20 API, hence the usage of JavaScript. They allow to get the attack, critical and maneuver roll results fast without needing to consult the rulebook tables, enabling games to run way smoother. TBD: make changes so this tools can be used in the command line using node.js  

## utils
### utils/roller.py
A roller tool to simulate any kind of RPG dice roll, like "3d6", "2d6+1d4-1", "1d17"... Made with Python. TBD: Dropping and keeping dice, roll with advantage/disadvantage...

### utils/shuffleroller.py
A tool to facilitate playing TTRPGs by WhatsApp or other chats where you cannot add a roller bot. Every DM has his share of players who don't want to install telegram, discord... But they want to do things with their characters between live sessions. This tool generates all possible results for a roll (i.e. 1-100 in 1d100) and shuffles them, displaying the shuffled list. Ex: 01:37, 02:88, 03:45... 99:21, 100:66. So you say to your pesky player who doesn't want to install telegram: "pick a number between 1 and 100" (or whatever the case). Then you use that number as the index in the shuffled list you've generated using this tool and that's the roll result. TBD: Allow for bell curves, like in 3d6 (it's not 3-18 shuffled, because 9-12 are much more probable than 3 or 18)

## 5e/API
Utils for Dungeons and Dragons 5e. Utilities I made using JavaScript for the Roll20 API. When I was no longer a Pro subscriber in Roll20, I changed them so they can be executed using Node.js in the command line.

It's basically a collection of three tools, a character generator, a climate generator and random treasure generator for my West Marches campaign using (a house ruled version of) Dungeons and Dragons 5e.

Made during the covid pandemic in Summer'20. Code is (veeery) unpolished, don't send a mob to my house for heresy XD.

## OSR/SwordsAndWizardry
Utilities for the OSR RPG Swords and Wizardry
- __chargen.py__: quick&dirty character generator for (my house ruled version of) Swords & Wizardry. Please, don't judge me by this ðŸ˜…, I needed something quick, so the code is very far from polished.

## rusty_roller
Another roller tool made with Rust. Util to simulate any kind of RPG dice roll, like "3d6", "2d6+1d4-1", "1d17"... Made in Rust to support my learning of that language. TBD: Dropping and keeping dice, roll with advantage/disadvantage...

## rusty_byte
This doesn't actually belongs here, it was to be uploaded to my `Rust` repository, but anyway. A byte class in Rust which allows to do bitwise manipulation (setting and getting concrete bits, slices...)
