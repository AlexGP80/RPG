*** Class Abilities ***
SPELL CASTING: Unlike the Cleric, a Magic-User owns a book of spells, which does not necessarily include all of the spells on the standard lists. Reading from this book, Magic-Users force selected spell formulae into their minds, “preparing” as many spells as the Magic-User can mentally sustain. (It is possible to prepare a spell multiple times using the available “slots” in the Magic-User’s memory and mental capability.) Once a prepared spell is cast, it disappears from the Magic-User’s ability to cast, until it is prepared again. If a Magic-User finds scrolls of spells while adventuring, these spells can be added to the Magic-User’s spellbook.

SAVING THROW BONUS: Magic-Users gain a bonus of +2 on all saving throw rolls against spells, including spells from magic wands and staffs.

IDENTIFY MAGIC ITEMS: Magic-Users can attempt to identify the properties of magic items. Chance equal to learn spell %. It takes 1 full day of study and analysis of the item to earn a chance to uncover a property. Each subsequent attempt, regardless of whether or not earlier attempts were successful, escalates in time: 1 day, 3 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months. This research may cost money in the form of materials.
