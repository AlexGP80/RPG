*** Class Abilities ***
DEADLY STRIKE: When the Monk’s attack roll is 5 higher than the required to hit number, the target has a 75% chance to be stunned by the blow for 2d6 rounds. Moreover, the mystic perfection of the blow also has a 25% chance to kill the opponent, provided the opponent’s hit dice are no more than 1 higher than the Monk’s.

ALERTNESS: Monks are not easily attacked by surprise. A party containing a Monk is unlikely to be surprised, with only a 1 in 6 chance.

DEFLECT MISSILES: The Monk can deflect arrows and magic missile spells with a successful saving throw.

SAVING THROW BONUS: Monks gain a +2 bonus against paralysis and poisons.
