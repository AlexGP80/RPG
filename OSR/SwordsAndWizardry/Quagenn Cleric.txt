*** Class Abilities ***
SPELL CASTING: Clerics cast “divine” spells from a specific list, with numbers as per the Cleric Advancement table. Clerics of specific deities might have different lists of available spells, designed by the Referee. Each day, the Cleric selects and prays for a particular set of spells, choosing any spells from the standard list. Once a spell is cast it cannot be cast again until the next day, unless the Cleric has prepared (prayed for) the spell more than once.

BANISHING UNDEAD: Lawful Clerics can “turn” undead monsters (see “Turning the Undead” in the Combat Section), making them flee from the Cleric’s holiness. Whether Chaotic Clerics can affect undead at all is up to the Referee.

SAVING THROW BONUS: Clerics gain a +2 bonus on saving throw rolls against being paralyzed or poisoned.
