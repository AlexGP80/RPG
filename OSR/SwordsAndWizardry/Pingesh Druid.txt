Each day, the Druid selects and prays for a particular set of spells, choosing any spells from the standard Druid spell list. Once a spell is cast, it cannot be cast again until the next day, unless the Druid has prepared (prayed for) the spell more than once.

SAVING THROW BONUS: Druids gain a +2 bonus on saving throw rolls against fire.

MAGIC ITEMS: Druids are able to use any magical item Clerics can, with the exception of Clerical-spell scrolls.
