*** Class Abilities ***
LAY ON HANDS: A Paladin can “lay on hands” once per day to cure others of 2 hit points of damage per level of the Paladin, or to cure disease. If the other person is afflicted by more than one disease, only one of these will be affected per five levels the Paladin has attained.

INMUNE TO DISEASES: Paladins are immune to all diseases.

WARHORSE: At any level, the character may summon a warhorse that will arrive from the wilderness to serve as the Paladin’s steed. This warhorse will be unusually intelligent and extremely strong (5 HD). However, if the horse is killed, the Paladin may not summon another within a period of ten game-years.
